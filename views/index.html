        <h3>Understanding Republican Cruelty</h3>
        <em>JUNE 30, 2017 by New York Times</em>
        <p>The basics of Republican health legislation, which haven’t changed much in different iterations of Trumpcare, are easy to describe: Take health insurance away from tens of millions, make it much worse and far more expensive for millions more, and use the money thus saved to cut taxes on the wealthy. Donald Trump may not get this — reporting by The Times and others, combined with his own tweets, suggests that he has no idea what’s in his party’s legislation. But everyone in Congress understands what it’s all about. The puzzle — and it is a puzzle, even for those who have long since concluded that something is terribly wrong with the modern G.O.P. — is why the party is pushing this harsh, morally indefensible agenda.

According to a new citywide survey of resident satisfaction, New Yorkers tended to give high marks to fire services, emergency medical services, garbage pickup and neighborhood life regardless of where they lived. They were also nearly unanimous in their low opinion of the city’s services for the homeless, public housing and use of their tax dollars. In general, New Yorkers are happiest with programs and services that directly affect their neighborhood and least happy with issues that relate to the city’s overall performance. (Most of the survey’s questions asked readers about directly about their neighborhood, but also asked respondents for their views on citywide issues, like traffic and homeless services.) “It’s kind of like the idea that I love my representative but I hate Congress,” said Maria Doulis, vice president of the Citizens Budget Commission, the organization that sponsored the survey this year.
